# Plant-Disease-Detection-With-Severity-Estimation-Using-CNN
This project implements a plant disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for identifying plant diseases from leaf images. It also estimates disease severity, aiding in precision agriculture by enabling early detection and targeted treatment for optimal crop management.
